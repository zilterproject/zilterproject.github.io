# COGS 120 / CSE 170 - Human-Computer Interaction Design

The goal of this course was to focus on hands-on practice with a modern 
human-centered design process while building a web application to serve a set 
of target users. This project aims to enhance recreational activity.

The way we materialized this goal was via Zilter, a web application concept 
that eases the shopping experience by consolidating all product research into 
one convenient place.

Online shopping for gadgets and appliances (e.g. TVs, laptops, headphones) can 
be a tedious task given that you need to acquire information to get the best 
product at the best price. Specifically, Zilter provides standard product 
information, photos, videos and official reviews gathered from websites. The 
sources are cited in a bibliography.
